You need to use the `typeof` operator to get the enumeration's underlying type, which in this case is `int`. So, your method should look like this:\n```\npublic void EnumerateAllSuitsDemoMethod()\n{\n    foreach (var suit in typeof(Suit))\n    {\n        DoSomething(suit);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn the `foreach` loop, you can use the `typeof(Suit)` keyword to get a reference to the `Suit` enum type, and then use this reference to get all of the values in the enum. The `var` keyword is used because the underlying type of an enum is actually `int`, so it doesn't make sense to try to specify the type of the variable as `Suit`."
